Motivation
**********



The motivation for this project was to create my first xlib program! Up to
this point i had been having trouble getting any of my code or any of the
example code i came across to work. I had worked as hard as i could by
myself, then i asked everyone i knew who might know something about xlib
programming but couldn't get any useful help; they all suggested i learn
Java instead (which at that time was relatively new and all hyped up). 

What It Does
************



You invoke this program on the command line. Pass in a string. A window will
open up and that string will scroll from left to right until the window is
clicked. Not earth shattering, but i was excited about it.

I just wanted to note that some of the inspiration for getting this code to
work came from the passing away of my Aunt Rita Smith. 

I had worked on this code off an on trying to get it to work and i just
couldn't seem to get it to do what i wanted. At that time i hadn't touched
the code in a while and was too frustrated with it to even want to try to
get it to work. I guess when she passed away, it put a different spin on my
outlook and i resolved to get it working; and so i did.
