        <title>Motivation</title>
        <para>
            The motivation for this project was to create my first xlib program!
            Up to this point i had been having trouble getting any of my code or any
            of the example code i came across to work.
            I had worked as hard as i could by myself, then i asked everyone i knew
            who might know something about xlib programming but couldn't get any
            useful help; they all suggested i learn Java instead (which at that time
            was relatively new and all hyped up).

        <title>What It Does</title>
        <para>
            You invoke this program on the command line. Pass in a string. A window will
            open up and that string will scroll from left to right until the window is
            clicked. Not earth shattering, but i was excited about it.

        <title>In Memorandum</title>
        <para>
            I just wanted to note that some of the inspiration for getting this code to
            work came from the passing away of my Aunt Rita Smith.
        </para>
        <para>
            I had worked on this code off an on trying to get it to work and i just couldn't
            seem to get it to do what i wanted. At that time i hadn't touched the code in
            a while and was too frustrated with it to even want to try to get it to work.
            I guess when she passed away, it put a different spin on my outlook and i resolved
            to get it working; and so i did.
